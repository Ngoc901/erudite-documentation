## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) describes all specifications for the application **ERUDITE**, a web-based platform for interactive learning with courses and challenges. It includes an overview of the system’s purpose, vision, features, and constraints.

### 1.2 Scope
The project will be implemented as a **web platform** with courses, modules, and challenges.  

Actors of this platform can be
- **Guest** – browse limited catalog, register.
- **Student** – enroll in courses, complete challenges, comment, view rankings.
- **Author/Instructor** – create courses/modules/challenges, configure availability, review/grade submissions, moderate comments in their courses.
- **Moderator** – global moderation of content/reports.
- **Administrator** – manage users, roles, settings.

Planned subsystems:  
- **Authentication & Profiles**: Registration/login (email, OAuth), profile with stats, privacy settings.  
- **Courses & Topics**: Catalog with filters, structured into topics and challenges.  
- **Challenges**: Multiple types (text, quiz).  
- **Answers & Grading**: Auto-check grading with rubric.  
- **Ranking & Gamification**: Points, badges, course-based leaderboards.  
- **Comments & Moderation**: Discussion threads, reports, moderation tools.  
- **Admin Panel**: Manage users, courses, system settings.
