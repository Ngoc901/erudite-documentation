Feature: Create a new challenge

  As a Teacher
  I want to create a challenge in a topic
  so that students can solve it.

  Background:
    I am logged in as a Teacher
    And I am on the "topic details" page

  Scenario: Create challenge
    When I click "add challenge"
    Then the "create challenge" form appears

  Scenario: Create a challenge with valid data
    When I enter "Challenge 1" as title
    And the exercise as body
    And "medium" as difficulty
    And "15" as points
    And upload "diagram.png"
    And set "42" as correct answer
    And press "create"
    Then I see the "challenge details" page
    And a success message

  Scenario: Fail to create a challenge with invalid data
    When I leave title and body empty
    And do not select a difficulty
    And enter "-10" as points
    And press "create"
    Then I stay on the "create challenge" page
    And an error message is shown
```
